- 👋 Hi, I’m @anthonysingiser
- 👀 I’m interested in web/application development. In general I like to make fun and/or interesting things to make things better for people.
- 🌱 I have completed courses over the past year on Javascript, JSX/React, Git and Unix. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I think is fun, funny or interesting. I like laughing (smiling is my favorite) and I love people.
